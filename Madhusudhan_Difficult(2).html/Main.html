        Git, CSS, and HTML together form a powerful foundation for modern web development. HTML provides the structure of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images, while CSS enhances its appearance by adding styles, layouts, and responsiveness to make websites visually appealing and user-friendly. Git complements these technologies by enabling version control, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and manage different versions of their projects with ease. When combined, HTML and CSS handle the creation and design of web content, while Git ensures that the development process is organized, efficient, and collaborative, making them essential tools for building and maintaining professional websites and applications.
