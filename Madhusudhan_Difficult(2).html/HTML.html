        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <dd>
            HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of the World Wide Web and one of the most essential tools in web development. It is not a programming language but a markup language, which means it is used to describe the structure of web content rather than perform calculations or logical operations. Every website you see today—whether it’s a simple blog or a complex web application—uses HTML as the foundation for displaying text, images, videos, and interactive elements. Without HTML, browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge would have no instructions on how to interpret and present information to users. In simple terms, HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage, which is later styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript

        <h2>History of HTML</h2>
        <dd>
            The story of HTML begins in the early 1990s with Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1991, he introduced the first version of HTML, which contained just 18 simple tags. The purpose was straightforward: to allow scientists and researchers to share documents easily over the internet. Over time, as the web grew beyond academia and into public use, HTML also evolved<br /> By 1995, HTML 2.0 was released as the first official standard, followed by HTML 3.2 in 1997, which introduced features like tables, applets, and image alignment. In 1999, HTML 4.01 became widely popular and added more options for developers to structure and format content. However, as web applications became more advanced, developers began facing limitations with HTML alone, which led to the creation of XHTML and eventually HTML5. Released in 2014, HTML5 marked a major revolution by adding support for audio, video, graphics, and semantic tags like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/header">header</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/footer">footer</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/section">section</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/article">article</a>. This modern version of HTML made the web richer, more accessible, and better suited for mobile devices

        <h2>Structure and Working of HTML</h2>
        <dd>
            HTML works through elements, which are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/p">p</a> for paragraphs or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements">h1</a> for headings). Each tag serves a different purpose . The structure of an HTML document usually begins with a doctype declaration <b><u>!DOCTYPE html</u></b> , followed by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">html</a> element, which contains two main sections: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/head">head</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/body">body</a>. The head holds metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts, while the body contains the actual content that users see on the screen. This simple but powerful structure allows developers to build organized and readable web pages

        <h2>Features of HTML</h2>
        <dd>
            HTML has several features that make it both easy to learn and extremely useful. It is platform-independent, meaning a webpage written in HTML can be viewed on any device or operating system as long as a browser is available. It supports multimedia integration, enabling developers to embed images, videos, and audio directly into web pages. Another important feature is its semantic elements, which give meaning to content, making web pages more accessible for screen readers and improving search engine optimization (SEO). Additionally, HTML is constantly updated and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and WHATWG, ensuring that it keeps up with modern web standards.

        <h2>Importance of HTML in Web Development</h2>
        <dd>
            The importance of HTML cannot be overstated. It is the first step for anyone learning web development, as it teaches the logic of structuring and presenting content. Businesses rely on HTML to build websites that act as their online identity, while developers use it to create everything from simple landing pages to complex web applications. Moreover, HTML ensures that websites are accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies. Without HTML, the internet would lose its universal structure and consistency.

        <h2>HTML and Other Web Technologies</h2>
        <dd>
            While HTML defines the structure of a web page, it often works hand-in-hand with other technologies. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements by controlling aspects like fonts, colors, layouts, and responsiveness, making pages visually appealing. JavaScript, on the other hand, brings interactivity to HTML by enabling dynamic features such as form validation, animations, and real-time updates. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the “holy trinity” of web development. Additionally, HTML also interacts with backend technologies and databases through frameworks, making it a critical link in the overall web ecosystem.

        <h2>Future of HTML</h2>
        <dd>
            As technology advances, HTML continues to evolve. The focus now is on making the web more accessible, mobile-friendly, and efficient. HTML5 already replaced the need for third-party plugins like Flash by supporting native video and audio playback. In the future, we can expect HTML to integrate even more seamlessly with new technologies such as progressive web apps (PWAs), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI). The language’s adaptability ensures it will remain at the heart of the internet for decades to come.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <dd>
            In conclusion, HTML is far more than just a set of tags—it is the language of the web, shaping the way billions of people around the globe access and share information every day. From its humble beginnings in the early 1990s to the feature-rich HTML5 we use today, it has consistently adapted to meet the needs of developers and users alike. Easy to learn yet powerful enough to support modern applications, HTML continues to be the entry point for anyone aspiring to become a web developer. By working in harmony with CSS and JavaScript, it allows for the creation of visually stunning, highly interactive, and universally accessible websites, ensuring that the web remains a powerful tool for communication, business, and innovation.
