        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <dd>
            CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation, design, and layout of web pages. While HTML provides the structure of content, CSS determines how that content looks, including colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness across different devices. It allows developers to separate content from design, ensuring that websites are visually appealing and consistent. Without CSS, all websites would look plain, displaying only raw HTML elements without styling or formatting.

        <h2>History of CSS</h2>
        <dd>
            CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 while working with Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web. The first official specification, CSS1, was released in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It introduced basic styling such as fonts, colors, and text alignment. Later, CSS2 (1998) expanded features to include positioning, z-index, and media types. The real breakthrough came with CSS3, which was introduced in 1999 but fully adopted in the early 2010s. CSS3 introduced modules, making it easier to implement advanced features like transitions, animations, shadows, gradients, and responsive design. Today, CSS continues to evolve with CSS4 concepts and new modules being added for modern web needs.

        <h2>Structure and Working of CSS</h2>
        <dd>
            CSS works through rules that define how HTML elements should appear. A CSS rule consists of a <b>selector</b> and a set of <b>declarations</b>. The selector identifies the HTML element to style (e.g., <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p">p</a> for paragraphs), while the declaration specifies the style in the form of property-value pairs (e.g., <code>color: blue;</code>). Styles can be applied in three ways: inline CSS (inside an element’s <code>style</code> attribute), internal CSS (inside the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style">style</a> tag in the head section), and external CSS (linked via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">link</a> to a .css file). Among these, external CSS is the most common as it promotes reusability and cleaner code.

        <h2>Features of CSS</h2>
        <dd>
            CSS provides powerful features that make websites attractive and responsive. It allows for styling of text, backgrounds, and layouts, supports responsive design with media queries, and enables advanced effects such as transitions, animations, and transformations. CSS also supports flexbox and grid systems, which make complex layouts easier to implement. Another feature is the cascading nature of CSS, where styles can inherit and override rules based on specificity and importance, ensuring flexibility in design.

        <h2>Importance of CSS in Web Development</h2>
        <dd>
            CSS is vital for creating modern websites because it separates structure from design. This makes web pages easier to maintain and update while ensuring visual consistency across multiple pages. For businesses, CSS enhances branding by providing control over how their online presence looks. It also plays a major role in accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring websites adapt to different devices, from desktops to smartphones. Without CSS, websites would appear dull and uniform, offering poor user experiences.

        <h2>CSS and Other Web Technologies</h2>
        <dd>
            CSS works closely with HTML and JavaScript to form the foundation of web development. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles design and layout, while JavaScript adds interactivity. For example, HTML can define a button, CSS can style it with colors and animations, and JavaScript can make it functional by responding to clicks. Together, these technologies create modern, dynamic, and responsive websites.

        <h2>Future of CSS</h2>
        <dd>
            The future of CSS is exciting, with constant updates introducing new modules and features. Emerging concepts like CSS Grid Level 2, CSS Subgrid, and container queries are making layouts more powerful and flexible. CSS is also becoming more performance-focused, enabling faster rendering and improved responsiveness. As technology evolves, CSS will continue to adapt to support new devices, user experiences, and design trends such as dark mode, 3D effects, and advanced animations.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <dd>
            In conclusion, CSS is more than just a tool for styling—it is what gives life and personality to websites. From its beginnings in the mid-1990s to the powerful CSS3 features we use today, it has revolutionized web design by enabling developers to create visually stunning, user-friendly, and responsive experiences. Without CSS, the web would be static and unattractive, but with it, developers can craft dynamic, engaging, and accessible digital worlds. By working seamlessly with HTML and JavaScript, CSS remains a cornerstone of web development, shaping the internet as we know it.
