<h2>About Madhusudhan.S</h2><hr />
<p>I have studied my 1st to 10th in the same school i.e.. Holy Saint High School.I cleared my 10 with a decent percentage of 80 in which the highest scored subject was Biology.<br />Then is the start of my colleege life where I joined Narayana College in JP Nagar 7th phase.This is the place where I experienced hell with no sports,activities,events the only thing they used to force us was about studies with really hectic time scedule starting from morning 7am to night 7 or 8pm.I had decent two years and with that heavy burden of studies I somehow got 89.87% in my second puc.<br />I am doing by B.E in BNM Institute of technologies in Banashankari 2nd stage and a decent first year but the same complaints as the same of Narayana with no events,etc.</p>
